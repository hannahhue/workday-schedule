# <WorkdaySchedule>

## Description

This schedule should allow you to easily keep track of any upcoming events and organize yor day! to complete this we mostly used moment.js, as well as bootstrap and of course JQuery. My motivation for this was to become more familair with these tools and try to show my ability to implement them within a working code. This program is meant to solve the ability to not know what is happeneing ever. simple yet effective, this will help even the most unorganized person!
